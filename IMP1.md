# Implementation Plan for Phase 1: Refactoring without Changing Functionality

## Current State Analysis
The `flowgre.go` file is currently a monolithic structure that handles:
- Command-line argument parsing for multiple subcommands (single, barrage, record, replay, proxy)
- Direct execution of these commands
- Error handling with `panic`
- Mixed configuration management approaches

## Phase 1 Goals
1. Create a new package structure for commands
2. Move existing command implementations to their respective packages
3. Implement a common base command structure
4. Replace `panic` with proper error handling throughout the codebase

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create New Package Structure

Create dedicated packages for each subcommand:
- cmd/single/
- cmd/barrage/
- cmd/record/
- cmd/replay/
- cmd/proxy/

Also create a common package for shared functionality:
- cmd/common/

### Step 2: Move Existing Command Implementations

Move the existing implementation files to their respective packages. This includes:
- Moving single.go to cmd/single/
- Moving barrage.go to cmd/barrage/
- Moving record.go to cmd/record/
- Moving replay.go to cmd/replay/
- Moving proxy.go to cmd/proxy/

### Step 3: Implement a Common Base Command Structure

Create a base command structure in cmd/common/ that will:
1. Handle common CLI argument parsing
2. Provide standard help and version output
3. Implement proper error handling patterns

### Step 4: Replace `panic` with Proper Error Handling

Throughout the codebase, replace instances of `panic` with proper error handling:
- Return errors from functions where appropriate
- Handle errors at higher levels when they can be meaningfully addressed
- Add logging for different severity levels (info, warning, error)

### Step 5: Update Main Entry Point

Refactor flowgre.go to:
1. Use Cobra or a similar library for command-line parsing
2. Delegate execution to the appropriate command package
3. Handle errors gracefully

## Detailed Task List

1. **Create new package structure**
   - Create directories: cmd/single, cmd/barrage, cmd/record, cmd/replay, cmd/proxy, cmd/common
   - Move existing files to these locations

2. **Implement common base command**
   - Create a base command struct in cmd/common/
   - Implement common functionality like help output and error handling

3. **Refactor each subcommand**
   - Update each subcommand to use the common base
   - Replace `panic` with proper error handling
   - Ensure consistent configuration management

4. **Update main entry point**
   - Refactor flowgre.go to use Cobra for CLI parsing
   - Delegate execution to appropriate command packages
   - Implement graceful shutdown on errors

5. **Testing**
   - Verify that all commands work as expected after refactoring
   - Ensure no functionality has been changed during the refactoring process
